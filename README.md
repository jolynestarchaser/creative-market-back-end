# 🎨 Creative Market — Human-Made Art Marketplace (Backend)

**Creative Market Backend** is a RESTful API service powering a digital marketplace dedicated 100% to human-made art. Built with Node.js + Express.js and connected to MongoDB, it handles all business logic for products, users, cart management, image uploads, and authentication — ensuring every transaction on the platform is backed by a fast, secure, and scalable API.

## 🧩 What This API Powers

The backend serves as the engine for a trust-first art marketplace where every listed item is guaranteed to be human-made. It exposes structured endpoints consumed by the React frontend to support:

- Full product lifecycle (create, browse, detail, upload)
- User authentication and session management
- Cart and order processing
- Artist content management
- Admin monitoring and oversight
